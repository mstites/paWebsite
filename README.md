# Peer Advocate Website
An unofficial website for the Olin College of Engineering Peer Advocate's. Used [create.mstites.com](create.mstites.com) as a template. The plan is for this site to be moved to the [www.olin.edu](olin college) domain and servers as [pa.olin.edu](pa.olin.edu)).

Contains information about who the PAs are, how to contact them, how to become a PA, and a list of resources.

## Future Plans
* Replace placeholder logo
* Add a FAQ
* Fill in all site data
* Fix minor CSS issues
* Move to the olin.edu domain and host on official Olin college servers
